# Macros
 - signalsLite.C: macro to process MC output and mimic DAQ
 - merge.C: macro to merge files
 - parallel.py: parallelization script. To be improved: so far there is no queue, the next processes are started only after all the previous batch has been terminated. With this version is better to run geant4 macros that have similar processing time
